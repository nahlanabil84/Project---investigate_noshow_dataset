This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

The Dataset on Kaggel: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments">Medical Appointment No Shows</a>

- 'ScheduledDay' tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- 'Neighborhood' indicates the location of the hospital.
- 'Scholarship' indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program.
- 'No-show' it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.


**Questions**:
We're going to find:
- "What are most common reasons for patients for not showing up in thier appointments?"
- "Which factors affect showing up in appointments?"
